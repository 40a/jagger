/// to Jagger Jenkins plugin. In WebUI and PDF report summary values will be highlighted according to results of comparison @n

/// @section section_dm_describe_limits Describe limits for measured parameters
/// @n
/// @par What metrics can be compared to limits
/// You can apply limits to all measured parameters (aka metrics):
/// @li standard metrics (throughput, latency, percentiles) @n
/// @li monitoring metrics (resource utilization measured by Jagger agents) @n
/// @li custom metrics, validators @n
///
/// Summary values of these parameters will be compared to limits. @n
/// @n
/// @par How to describe limits
/// You can describe limits in any configuration XML file. Best practice - use separate file for this (f.e. @e limits.conf.xml) @n
/// On example below you can see one set of limits. There can be as many sets of limits as you need. @n
/// Example of limits description: @n
/// @dontinclude  limits.conf.xml
/// @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - description of limits for metrics
/// @until end: following section is used for docu generation - description of limits for metrics
/// @n
/// There can be following types of limits. See description of XML schema under type name links: @n
/// @xlink_complex{limit-vs-value} - metric will be compared with defined value @n
/// @xlink_complex{limit-vs-baseline} - metric will be compared with value from baseline session @n
/// @n
/// @par Where to get ids of standard and monitoring metrics
/// To define limit for metric you need to know id of metrics. @n
/// @li standard metrics ids. Use values from list below: @n
/// @dontinclude  StandardMetricsNamesUtil.java
/// @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - standard metrics ids
/// @until end: following section is used for docu generation - standard metrics ids
/// @li monitoring metrics ids: @n
/// @dontinclude  environment.properties
/// @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - Monitoring metrics ids
/// @until end: following section is used for docu generation - Monitoring metrics ids
/// @li custom metrics ids - you should know them. They are custom @n
///
/// @n
/// @par How limits and measured values are matched
/// How limits will match to metrics: @n
/// @li First exact match will be checked. Metric id from database will be compared to @e metricName attribute of limit @n
/// @li If first will not match, metric id from database will be compared to regular expression @b "^metricName.*"@n
///
/// This means limit with @e metricName 'mon_cpula_' will match metrics with ids: @n
/// <i> mon_cpula_1|jagger_connect_57 [127.0.1.1]|-avg </i> @n
/// <i> mon_cpula_5|jagger_connect_57 [127.0.1.1]|-avg </i> @n
/// <i> mon_cpula_15|jagger_connect_57 [127.0.1.1]|-avg </i> @n
/// @n
/// @par How to enable summary calculation for monitoring metrics
/// @b NOTE: Pay attention that summary is not calculated for monitoring parameters by default. You need to enable this calculation @n
/// in property file. Like on example below: @n
/// @dontinclude  environment.properties
/// @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - How to enable summary calculation for monitoring metrics
/// @until end: following section is used for docu generation - How to enable summary calculation for monitoring metrics
/// @n
/// Back to @ref section_dm_overview @n
/// @n
///
///
/// @section section_dm_attach_limits Attach limits to particular test(s)
/// @n
/// After describing limits you can attach them to some test or tests. That means your limits will be used @n
/// to verify results of some test(s) and make decision. Single set of limits can be attached to several tests. @n
/// It is convenient when same acceptance criteria are used for different tests. @n
/// Example: @n
/// @dontinclude  suite.conf.xml
/// @skip  begin: following section is used for docu generation - attaching limits to test
/// @until end: following section is used for docu generation - attaching limits to test
/// @n
/// Another option is to define limits directly in the test, like on example below: @n
